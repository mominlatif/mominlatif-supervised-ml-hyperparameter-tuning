# mominlatif-supervised-ml-hyperparameter-tuning
Building and optimizing Supervised Learning Models (Regression/Classification). The goal is to implement, train, and tune models using techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to achieve optimal performance.

üéØ Objectives

Load and prepare a dataset for supervised learning.

Train regression/classification models.

Apply hyperparameter tuning to improve results.

Evaluate and visualize model performance.

Save trained models for future use.

üõ†Ô∏è Workflow
1. Dataset Preparation

Load preprocessed dataset.

Separate features (X) and target (y).

Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

2. Model Training

Implement supervised learning models such as:

Regression: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor

Classification: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier

Train models using training data.

3. Hyperparameter Tuning

Apply GridSearchCV and/or RandomizedSearchCV.

Define parameter grid for chosen model(s).

Use cross-validation to identify the best hyperparameters.

Compare model performance before vs after tuning.

4. Model Evaluation

Regression Metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R¬≤ Score

Classification Metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Confusion Matrix

Visualizations:

Predictions vs. Actual values (for regression).

Confusion matrix heatmap (for classification).

5. Model Saving

Save trained models using pickle or joblib for reuse
